1. Differentiate **acronym** and **abbreviation**
	- When should we use the word **acronym** and when to use **abbreviation**? 
		- Use **acronym** when referring specifically to those abbreviations that create a new word from the initial letters.
		- Use **abbreviation** when discussing any shortened form of a word or phrase, including acronyms.
	- Any rules to apply when we use them ?
		- **Acronyms**
			- **First use:** When using an **acronym** for the first time in a document, spell out the full phrase followed by the acronym in parentheses. For example: *"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is launching a new mission."*
			- **Consistency**: Once an **acronym** is defined, you can use it on its own throughout the rest of the text.
			- **Pronunciation**: Ensure that your audience is likely to recognize and understand the **acronym**. If it’s obscure, consider providing the full phrase again.
		- **Abbreviations**
			- **Common Abbreviations**: Use standard **abbreviations** (like Dr., Inc., etc.) as long as they are widely recognized and accepted.
			- **Avoiding Confusion**: Be cautious with less common **abbreviations**, they may confuse readers. If there’s any doubt, spell it out.
			- **Periods**: Some style guides recommend using periods for abbreviations (e.g., U.S.) while others do not (e.g., US). Be consistent with whichever style you choose.
			- **Formal Writing**: In formal writing, limit the use of **abbreviations** and **acronyms** to ensure clarity.
			- **Context**: Consider the audience and context; adjust your use of **acronyms** and **abbreviations** accordingly to maintain clarity.
